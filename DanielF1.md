If someone does wrong by me on the track, I get I get to be honest, I get instant kind of anger and an instant emotion.
But I'm aware that sometimes being emotional is not the most constructive thing. But I certainly do feel an anger and
my immediate feeling as well as **retaliation**. You've got a lot of feelings going on. And you know, again you've got emotion
and anger. But you've also gotta kind of quickly **compose** yorself because you've got another corner coming up. (Awesome 
job mate). You know, you've got other things to manage and you can't let one split second. Feeling **dictate** the rest of your
race.
